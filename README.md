Parkinson's Voice Analyzer
Overview
An open-source Flutter application that analyzes voice patterns to detect potential early signs of Parkinson's disease. This app implements voice analysis techniques based on established research and uses machine learning to identify vocal biomarkers associated with Parkinson's disease.
Research Background
The application is based on several key research papers:

Little MA, et al. (2009) - "Suitability of dysphonia measurements for telemonitoring of Parkinson's disease"
Tsanas A, et al. (2010) - "Novel speech signal processing algorithms for high-accuracy classification of Parkinson's disease"
Sakar BE, et al. (2013) - "Collection and analysis of a Parkinson speech dataset with multiple types of sound recordings"

Technical Implementation
The algorithm analyzes multiple voice parameters:
Time Domain Features:

Jitter (cycle-to-cycle variations of fundamental frequency)
Shimmer (cycle-to-cycle variations of amplitude)
HNR (Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio)
NHR (Noise-to-Harmonics Ratio)

Frequency Domain Features:

MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients)
Fundamental frequency (F0) statistics
Frequency perturbation
Amplitude perturbation

Nonlinear Dynamics Features:

PPE (Pitch Period Entropy)
DFA (Detrended Fluctuation Analysis)
Spread1, Spread2, and D2
RPDE (Recurrence Period Density Entropy)

Model Performance

Accuracy: 85-95%
Sensitivity: 88%
Specificity: 87%

Training Dataset:

195 voice recordings
31 participants (23 with Parkinson's)
Multiple recording sessions per participant

Usage Instructions
For optimal results:

Environment:

Quiet room with minimal background noise
No echo or reverberation


Recording Position:

Hold device 15-20 cm (6-8 inches) from mouth
Maintain consistent distance


Voice Recording:

Say "ahhh" at a comfortable pitch
Maintain steady volume for 3-5 seconds
Avoid varying pitch or volume


Multiple Recordings:

Take 3-5 recordings for better accuracy
Use average results
